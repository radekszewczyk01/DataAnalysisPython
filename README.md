### Inspiration

I started a quest to investigate global development from a data-driven perspective after being inspired by **Hans Rosling's Factfulness**. The book dispels myths about the world and shows that many nations have achieved notable advancements in fields like wealth, education, and health. Rosling highlights how crucial it is to base our worldview on factual information rather than fanciful or out-of-date stories.

This viewpoint motivated me to examine the GDP growth of various nations over time. I want to find patterns and trends in economic data that correspond with the advancements emphasized in Factfulness. By going beyond the crude divisions of "developed" and "developing" countries, this method enables a more nuanced picture of global development.

In line with Rosling's concept of "possibilism"—the conviction that, despite the world's difficulties, there are also chances for progress when we are aware of the facts.

### My aproach

To carry out this analysis, I used Python along with the powerful data analysis libraries Pandas and NumPy. These tools allowed me to efficiently clean, manipulate, and explore large datasets.

For the data itself, I relied on the World Bank's open data, which offers a rich source of global development indicators, including GDP figures for virtually every country over multiple decades. This dataset provided the foundation for examining long-term economic growth trends across different regions and income levels.

By combining these tools with insights from Factfulness, my goal was to better understand how the world has changed over time—not just in theory, but through concrete numbers.
