### Inspiration

I started a quest to investigate global development from a data-driven perspective after being inspired by Hans Rosling's Factfulness. The book dispels myths about the world and shows that many nations have achieved notable advancements in fields like wealth, education, and health. Rosling highlights how crucial it is to base our worldview on factual information rather than fanciful or out-of-date stories.

This viewpoint motivated me to examine the GDP growth of various nations over time. I want to find patterns and trends in economic data that correspond with the advancements emphasized in Factfulness. By going beyond the crude divisions of "developed" and "developing" countries, this method enables a more nuanced picture of global development.
